The 2024 Transcend Short Vignette Contest

Submissions will be open from March 1st 2024 to July 31st 2024.

Stories are considered by senior editing staff (no outside readers); guest judge reads finalists.

Throughout the process, readers will be notified if their story is passed on or reaches the finalist pool. This often results in a quicker response than other contests, where writers often have to wait until everything has been decided.

The winner will be announced in November 2024.

The winning short story will be published in the 2026 anthology.

In the shadowy corner of the interstellar tavern, Captain Xaviera Kade sipped her neon-green martini. Her sharp blue gaze flickered across the bar, assessing potential allies and enemies alike. A hush fell over the crowd as a cloaked figure entered, radiating an aura of power and mystery. Xaviera felt a shiver run down her spine; this newcomer could either make or break her mission. As she finished her drink, Xaviera made up her mind – it was time to make her move.

Clara’s heartbeat thudded against her ribs as the automaton lowered its porcelain face to hers, the clockwork gears humming beneath its surface. "You’re lying," it said, the faintest vibration in its voice resembling amusement. She clenched the schematic tighter behind her back, her father’s final invention the only leverage she had left. "I’m not," she whispered, hating how weak her voice sounded. The automaton’s golden eyes glinted; it reached out with a perfect, inhuman hand, and her mind screamed that it knew everything.
