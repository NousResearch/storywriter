I want five representative single sentence description 'prompts' for this vignette. imagine we're working backwards: if we were to make a story writing contest, the sentence we're making here could have inspired someone to write the given vignette. I will first provide some examples of prompts (for other vignettes, not this one!)

`he is an honorable man who held onto his soul`

`"Does this soul look crooked to you?"`

`command forgot to check with us first, private`

`surprise and delay even the most aggressive adversary. independently engage and repel attackers even if all human crew have been killed or disabled`

`say it's the end of an age`

`a story about a man named george who ruined everything`

given this vignette:

```
$USER_VIGNETTE
```

give me five prompts for:

- one grounded in the physical
- one grounded in the characters
- one that's thematic
- one that's a compromise between those factors
- one that's ambiguous but fits

make sure each prompt is its own plain text codeblock so they can be extracted by software.
