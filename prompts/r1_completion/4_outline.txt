<instruction>
Given the provided story structure, please try defining our overarching story structure using "problem/solution":

```
- Start with a central conflict or problem
- Design characters who are uniquely qualified/challenged to deal with it
- Map out possible solutions and complications
```

Then also work it out with tentpole:

```
- Identify 3-5 major scenes/moments that excite you
- Figure out what kind of characters would make these scenes meaningful
- Work out what needs to happen between these scenes
```

Then consider where to start the story with "character first":

```
- Start with an interesting character with clear wants/needs
- Put them in a situation that challenges them
- Let their decisions drive the plot
```

Finally, write out a detailed paragraph description of what the first chapter should be like, and three suggested opening hooks, also in a code block.

You may reason, ideate, explore out loud as much as you need to, but your final answer should be in a single XML block with your three outlines and your first chapter suggestions delimited by the tags `<outline>` and `</outline>`.
